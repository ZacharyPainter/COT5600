This python script calculates the minimal polynomial of a given square matrix. 

annihilate_min_degree_poly() takes a square matrix M and calculates the polynomial p(x) such that p(M) = 0. 

An example is provided demonstrating the minimal polynomial that annihilates the following matrix:
[0,1]
[1,0]
